## Base Image for PHP

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development, but which can also be used as a general-purpose programming
language. PHP can be added to straight HTML or it can be used with a variety of templating engines and web frameworks. PHP code
is usually processed by an interpreter, which is either implemented as a native module on the web-server or as a common gateway
interface (CGI).
